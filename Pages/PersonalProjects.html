                <p>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy prototyping gameplay ideas that come to mind and working on personal
                    projects. Here are a few of them:
                </p>

                <div class="projectPageSubtitle">
                    Procedural Potion Game
                </div>

                <p>
                    This is one of my latest personal projects. I have always liked <a
                        href="https://octopathtraveler.fandom.com/wiki/Concoct" target="_blank">Octopath Traveler's
                        potion
                        system</a> and <a href="https://magicka.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_combinations"
                        target="_blank">Magicka's dynamic spell creation</a>.
                    Both of them rely on mixing elements together to create a procedural result.

                    <br><br>

                    I started by making a top-down controller that could use this type of system. I wrote a full
                    documentation on potion effects and the status attributes they apply. It does not really fit in a
                    short paragraph here, but I made a <a href="VialenceDoc.html">port of the markdown documentation</a> to this website in case you are curious.

                    <br><br>

                    I created the architecture for the potions and made a tool that visualizes the effect a potion would
                    have. I then made an entity system with solid callbacks for status effects. The goal was to make it
                    as modular and designer-friendly as possible without the need for a separate tool. Below is an
                    example of the callback that triggers when the "Frozen" status effect is applied to a target that is
                    already "Burning".

                    <br><br>

                    After that, I implemented the first potion type from the documentation: bombs. Each bomb uses two
                    ingredients and can apply status effects. I eventually stopped working on this project because the
                    scope
                    was getting too large, but the project currently has a working base for all the systems mentioned
                    above.
                    In the video below, I showcase a few potions and explain how they interact with each other.

                <div class="projectPageSubtitle">
                    Dungeon generation algorithm
                </div>

                <p>
                    When I was a kid, I loved the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series. I found
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fudOO713qYo" target="_blank">this video</a>
                    explaining the algorithm behind their dungeon generation, so I decided to implement it in Unity.
                    The result is a fairly modular system that can create very different dungeon layouts, from simple
                    rooms
                    to more winding structures.
                    Overall, I think it stays quite faithful to the original, and I am happy with the result.

                    <br><br>

                    In the example below, the green cells are rooms, the yellow cells are walls, black cells are map
                    borders, and the cyan cells are corridors and dead ends.

                <div class="projectPageSubtitle">
                    Scribblenauts Object Creation Prototype
                </div>

                <p>
                    Back in 2021, I played Scribblenauts and really liked its main mechanic where you can spawn objects
                    by
                    typing their names.
                    I decided to make a small Unity prototype of this feature with a few simple objects and adjectives.
                </p>

                <div
                    style="position: relative; width: 60%; padding-bottom: 33.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekQsYZBpJGc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                        allowfullscreen
                        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>
                    I made this when I was learning Unity's ScriptableObjects, so the project ended up being quite
                    monolithic.
                    I would approach it very differently today. For example, I did not create any proper attribute
                    system,
                    which made conflicts hard to detect since the adjective checks were hard coded.
                    If I were to redo this prototype, I would probably build a tool similar to the one I describe in my
                    <a href="ExSilentio.html" target="_blank">Ex Silentio</a> project page to link concepts together
                    more
                    cleanly.
