                    <a href="https://nonogg.itch.io/viscera" target="_blank">Viscera</a> is a fast-paced first person
                    hack'n'slash arena fighter. We developed it as a team of 11 students in Unreal Engine 5 as our final
                    Masters project, over 5 months and alongside our classes.

                    The goal of the project was to build a vertical slice in a studio-sized team. As shown in the
                    trailer, the game offers two ways to defeat enemies: a violent approach and a non-violent one. The
                    violent approach plays like a classic melee first person game. You slash enemies to reveal their
                    weak points, then stab those weak points to finish them. The non-violent approach is more involved.
                    You can possess other enemies and play as them. Each time you possess a new body, you leave a trail
                    between your current and previous one. If you manage to possess enemies in a loop and close it by
                    returning to the first one, every enemy in the loop is removed peacefully. This may not be very
                    clear, so here is a video showcasing this feature :

                <br>
                We were three programmers on the project and we split the work according to what we saw as the three
                main challenges: a satisfying character controller with responsive movement and good juice, a solid
                enemy AI that reacts meaningfully to the player, and someone to handle the global architecture and
                everything that did not fall under the first two tasks.
                <br>
                <br>
                I handled the character controller. I worked closely with one of the two game designers to build the
                best version we could. We benchmarked several games such as ULTRAKILL, Boomerang X, and I Am Your
                Beast.
                <br>
                <br>
                I did two main things to make the controller easy to fine tune. The first one was to use a
                data-driven, component-based approach. Each component was responsible for exactly one behavior
                (movement, attack, and so on). Components listened for inputs, then looked at the shared player data
                to decide what to do. For example, if the player tried to attack, the PlayerCombat component checked
                the PlayerData.CanAttack helper method, which returned true only if the player was not already
                attacking or dashing. This approach made the system very clear for the designer, since they always
                knew exactly where to tweak a behavior.

                <p>
                    The second thing I focused on was making every behaviour as modular as possible through exposed
                    variables. This is a common practice, but it was important for this project because it let the
                    designers iterate quickly.

                    This was also my first experience creating a full game in Unreal Engine. I really enjoyed using the
                    engine, especially because it was a great fit for the project thanks to its built-in AI tools and
                    first person templates. What I liked less was how hard it can be to "break the mold". In my opinion,
                    if you want to do something in a way the engine was not originally designed for, it is noticeably
                    harder than in Unity.
