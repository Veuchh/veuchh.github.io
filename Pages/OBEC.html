                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689450/Obec/" target="_blank">OBEC</a> is a 3D
                    roguelike action boss combat game that combines Third-person ARPG and Solo Narrative Boss-rush
                    elements.

                <p>
                    I worked on a vertical slice of the project, which we used to pitch to publishers. Unfortunately,
                    despite several promising leads, we weren’t able to secure a deal. Still, I contributed to many
                    aspects of the game’s development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was responsible for most of the player and camera movement systems, which required extensive
                    tuning and iteration. To find the right feel, I benchmarked other games with similar design
                    philosophies - including Hi-Fi Rush, Sekiro, NieR: Automata, and Kingdom Hearts 2. Each of these
                    titles has a distinct game feel, and we carefully picked elements that fit OBEC’s style. For
                    example, we liked how Hi-Fi Rush keeps the camera stable during jumps, so I implemented that
                    behavior.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I believe that game design doesn’t always mean reinventing the wheel - sometimes, studying
                    and adapting what other games do well helps establish strong gameplay norms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The team followed an agile workflow, which fit perfectly for building a vertical slice. This aligned
                    especially well with our goal of making a vertical slice. During our sprints, I developed several
                    gameplay systems, including player movement, camera, combat, pet AI and movement, the buff system,
                    and level design tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall,this project was a fantastic learning experience for me, as well as my first paid
                    position as a gameplay programmer. I touched on a lot of different aspects of the game, and learned
                    a lot in the process. My main takeaways were the importance of benchmarking other games effectively
                    and the value of being versatile when working in a small studio environment..
