                <p>
                    I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.apperture.fr">Apperture</a>, in Bordeaux, France. It
                    is a serious games studio. I have had the opportunity to work on seven different projects, each with
                    different technologies and scopes. Most of these projects were serious games made for advertising or
                    communication in the medical field. Working on so many different projects also meant working with
                    multiple platforms such as PC, iOS, Android and VR.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I did not work on what most people would call traditional video games, I believe a large part
                    of my experience at this company translates directly to game development. Since the projects are
                    short, we need to iterate quickly with the client in order to respect deadlines. This also means
                    working closely with an artist and communicating clearly about integration needs. Apperture is a
                    relatively small studio, so we need to be polyvalent. Even though my main role is gameplay
                    programming, I often use skills related to networking, technical art, image editing, shader
                    programming and more. Finally, since many projects share similarities but have short deadlines,
                    there are great opportunities to build tools. I have not yet had the time to create tools myself for
                    the company, but I learned a lot by studying the pipelines put in place by the other developers.

                    Most of the projects I worked on at Apperture are under NDA, and I can sadly not talk about them.
                    However, one of the more interesting ones in my opinion was an installation for an exhibition
                    showcasing a new train model called “Telli”. This project was commissioned to Apperture by Graphics
                    eMotion, a video mapping company working for the SNCF. The goal was to have a Unity application
                    running on a Windows Surface Pro that acted as a remote for another application. The controlled
                    application was built with Unreal Engine, running on a separate machine and projected onto a wall to
                    simulate a full-scale train.

                    All interactions were made from the Unity remote application, and the feedback was visible in both
                    the Unreal and Unity applications.

                <p>
                    I decided early on that a client-server architecture would be the best fit for the project, since it
                    made handling disconnection and reconnection much easier. This quickly led to the decision that the
                    Unreal application would act as the server, with the Unity application serving as the client. They
                    needed to automatically find each other on the local network. Since they were not running on the
                    same machine, the client needed to discover the server’s IP address. I chose to handle this with UDP
                    broadcasting. The server regularly sends a small broadcast packet to the special address
                    255.255.255.255 on the local network. The Unity client listens for these broadcasts and, when it
                    receives one, it extracts the server's IP address from the packet. This avoids the need for manual
                    IP entry and makes the connection process much smoother for the user.
