            <p>
                Back when I was studying at CNAM-Enjmin, we created several installations using video game technology.
                The two projects showcased below allowed me to work with Arduino, which I really enjoyed.

            <div class="projectPageSubtitle">
                Slinghost
            </div>

            <p>
                <a href="https://zizelexe.itch.io/slinghost">Slinghost</a> is a project we made as a small team in 5
                days as part of an accessibility workshop. The game
                was designed to be playable by people with visual and audio impairments. Visual, audio and haptic
                feedback guide the player to locate the ghost. The custom-made physical slingshot also has an adjustable
                height, allowing people in wheelchairs to play. I mainly worked on the visual feedback with LEDs and an
                Arduino board, as well as the aim feature of the slingshot.

                Costellation
            </div>

            <p>
                <a href="https://zizelexe.itch.io/co-stellation">CoStellation</a> is the result of a three and a half
                day workshop focused on creating an interactive
                experience with simple inputs (a basic controller) while allowing outputs that were not limited to a
                screen. The idea was for two people to stargaze together at a procedurally generated sky. With simple
                inputs, players can draw constellations that remain in the sky for future stargazers to discover. We
                also provided a notebook where players could name their constellations.
