                    Game Jams
                </div>

                <p>
                    I also enjoy taking part in game jams from time to time. You can find a few of the games I worked on
                    below.

                    Frogged and Loaded
                </div>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://louis-vogel.itch.io/froggedandloaded">Frogged and Loaded</a> finished 5th in the
                    Micro Game Jam 41, and won 1st place in both Enjoyment and Controls. I made this game with another
                    programmer in 2 days. It’s admittedly a fairly classic game jam character controller: you fire a
                    weapon and only its recoil lets you move. Since you play as a frog, we also wanted to add a
                    tongue-based grapple. We focused most of our efforts on making the game as juicy as possible, since
                    it’s something both me and my programmer friend really enjoy working on.
                    <br><br>
                    A lot of fine-tuning went into the controller as well, and I’m quite happy with the result.

                    Pew Piou
                </div>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://skrimsly.itch.io/pew-piou">Pew Piou</a> is a multiplayer shoot’em up where, as
                    migratory birds, you and a friend must each rally as many birds to your group as possible.
                    <br><br>
                    To do so, you converse with the birds you encounter and convince them to join you. In gameplay, this
                    translates to raising a shield of the same color as the projectile they send, then passing through
                    it to reflect it. If you manage to reflect all projectiles from a bird, it will join your flock.
                    <br><br>
                    Pew Piou was made in 4 days by a team of 10 as part of our Master’s degree at CNAM-ENJMIN, with the
                    following constraints: it had to be a 2-player shoot’em up, use only 5 total inputs, and the
                    interactive experience had to last around 3 minutes.

                <p>
                    <a href="https://creamos.itch.io/buddies-breakout">Buddies Breakout</a> is a Hotline Miami–inspired
                    game where you can either play stealthily or go loud. The twist is that you can free your “buddies”,
                    each giving you a new interaction in the level and a new ability. We made this game as a team of
                    three over a week, working during evenings after our day jobs for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2. It
                    finished 24th in the Fun category out of 514 entries.

                    DiveBomb
                </div>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://louis-vogel.itch.io/divebomb" target="_blank">DiveBomb</a> is a game inspired by
                    the <a href="https://youtu.be/vBkCfVyYFdU?t=321" target="_blank">intro sequence of Saints Row 3</a>.
                    We worked on it as a small team of first- and second-year students at 3Axes Institut for the <a
                        href="https://itch.io/jam/juicy-jam-1/rate/1029573" target="_blank">Juicy Jam #1</a>. I mostly
                    worked on coordinating the first-year students and integrating their work, which was a great
                    introduction to basic project management.
                    <br><br>
                    In the game, you are free-falling from a plane and must score as many points as possible by blowing
                    everything up. We chose this concept because we felt it would be easy to create satisfying juice
                    from it, which was the theme of the jam. The game finished in 3rd place.

                    Deep Cut
                </div>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://louis-vogel.itch.io/deep-cut">Deep Cut</a> is another Hotline Miami–inspired game
                    that I worked on during a school game
                    jam when I was
                    in
                    my second year at 3Axes Institut. It was made over 3 days, and I was the sole programmer for a team
                    of 9
                    people. The twist is that you first explore the level without any hostile enemies, allowing you to
                    inspect the weapons lying around. Once the level actually starts, the appearance of each weapon
                    changes
                    regularly, but keeps the original weapon’s behaviour. For example, if you spot a katana on the
                    ground,
                    it might later look like a fish, but it will still behave as a katana.
